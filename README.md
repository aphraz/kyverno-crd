Manifest I created to practice some use-cases with Kyverno

### use-case-01 Enforcing Resource Limits
One of the most common use cases for creating custom policies is enforcing resource limits. Resource limits ensure that Kubernetes pods do not consume too much CPU or memory, which can cause performance issues or even bring down the entire cluster.

### use-case-02 Enforcing Custom Labels
Labels can help you organize your Kubernetes resources and apply policies based on specific labels. For example, you might want to enforce a policy that requires all pods to have a specific label.

### use-case-03 Enforcing Custom Annotations
Annotations can help you attach metadata to your Kubernetes resources. For example, you might want to enforce a policy that requires all pods to have a specific annotation.

### use-case-04 Enforcing Pod Security Policies
Pod security policies help you control the security settings of your Kubernetes pods. They allow you to control aspects such as the use of privileged containers, the use of host network or host IPC, and the use of certain volume types.

### use-case-05 Enforcing Custom Naming Conventions
Naming conventions can help you maintain consistency and avoid confusion in your Kubernetes cluster. For example, you might want to enforce a naming convention that requires all pods to have a specific prefix or suffix.

### use-case-06 Enforcing Service Accounts
Service accounts allow you to control access to Kubernetes resources. You might want to enforce a policy that requires all pods to use a specific service account.

### use-case-07 Enforcing Network Policies
Network policies allow you to control traffic flow to and from your Kubernetes pods. You might want to enforce a policy that restricts traffic to only certain IP ranges or ports.

### use-case-08 Enforcing Node Affinity
Node affinity allows you to control which nodes your Kubernetes pods are scheduled on. You might want to enforce a policy that requires all pods to be scheduled on nodes with a specific label.

### use-case-09 Enforcing Resource Limits
Resource limits allow you to control the amount of CPU and memory resources that your Kubernetes pods can use. You might want to enforce a policy that requires all pods to have specific resource limits.

### use-case-10 Enforcing Pod Restart Policies
Restart policies determine how Kubernetes handles pod restarts. You might want to enforce a policy that requires all pods to have a specific restart policy.

### use-case-11 Enforcing Pod Security Policies
Pod security policies allow you to control the security settings of your Kubernetes pods. You might want to enforce a policy that requires all pods to have specific security settings.

### use-case-12 Enforcing Pod Labels
Pod labels allow you to add metadata to your Kubernetes pods. You might want to enforce a policy that requires all pods to have specific labels.

### use-case-13 Enforcing Namespace Labels
Namespace labels allow you to add metadata to your Kubernetes namespaces. You might want to enforce a policy that requires all namespaces to have specific labels.

### use-case-14 Enforcing Resource Quotas
Resource quotas allow you to control the amount of resources that your Kubernetes namespaces can use. You might want to enforce a policy that requires all namespaces to have specific resource quotas.

### use-case-15 Enforcing Pod Placement Constraints
Pod placement constraints allow you to control where your Kubernetes pods are scheduled. You might want to enforce a policy that requires all pods to be scheduled on nodes with specific taints or tolerations.
